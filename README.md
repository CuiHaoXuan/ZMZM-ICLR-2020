This repository contains code for the numerical and image experiments presented in the [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJeY-1BKDS).

## Description 

[image-experiments](https://github.com/hermish/ZMZM-ICLR-2020/tree/master/image-experiments) contains codes and results for all image experiments in Figure 5, 6, and 7.  

[msp-comparison](https://github.com/hermish/ZMZM-ICLR-2020/tree/master/msp-comparison), [rtr-comparison](https://github.com/hermish/ZMZM-ICLR-2020/tree/master/rtr-comparison), and [sg-comparison](https://github.com/hermish/ZMZM-ICLR-2020/tree/master/sg-comparison) contain codes for reproducing comparison experiments in Table 2.

The Riemannian subgradient descent and trust-region method implementations used are based on those provided by the original authors [1, 2]; the original code, along with our modifications, can be found in the appropriate folders. For any questions or bug reports, please feel free to reach out!

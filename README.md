This repository contains code for the numerical and image experiments presented in the [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJeY-1BKDS).

The Riemannian subgradient descent and trust-region method implementations used are based on those provided by the original authors [1, 2]; the original code, along with our modifications, can be found in the appropriate folders. For any questions or bug reports, please feel free to reach out!
